# FHV-Latex template

To use this template, it is recommened to work with 
[TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net). 
You can use the given profile provided in 
[scripts](https://github.com/pasrom/FHV-Latex/tree/master/scripts) 
(Mac, Windows, Linux is not supported yet, but should be same as Mac). 

The bibliography uses Biber to build and is adapted to FHV guidelines.

I also recommend to use 
[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) Latex distribution.
